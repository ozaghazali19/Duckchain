3. Inspect Element `(F12)` on the keyboard
4. at the top of the choose "`Application`" 
5. then select "`Session Storage`" 
6. Select the links "`DuckChain bot`" and "`tgWebAppData`"
7. Take the value part of "`tgWebAppData`"
8. take the part that looks like this: 

```txt 
query_id=xxxxxxxxx-Rxxxxuj&user=%7B%22id%22%3A1323733375%2C%22first_name%22%3A%22xxxx%22%2C%22last_name%22%3A%22%E7%9A%BF%20xxxxxx%22%2C%22username%22%3A%22xxxxx%22%2C%22language_code%22%3A%22id%22%2C%22allows_write_to_pm%22%3Atrue%7D&auth_date=xxxxx&hash=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
9. add it to `tokens.txt` file or create it if you dont have one
